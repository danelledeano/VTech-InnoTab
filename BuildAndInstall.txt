This document describes how to build and install a custom kernel to 
vtech InnoTab (126800).


This package contains:
	a) instruction document, i.e. this document.
	b) sources of modified Linux kernel (sdk/os/kernel-2.6.32/),
	c) sources of Busybox and other programs (sdk/external/),
	d) binaries of proprietary programs,
	e) scripts and makefiles for compile and build,
	f) tools to pack the kernel and install it to InnoTab hardware,



!!!!!!!!!!!!!
!! Warning !!
!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1. Do NOT cut the power supply when installing the kernel file(s) to InnoTab
hardware, otherwise it may corrupt the InnoTab hardware that cannot power up 
again.
2. Once you installed custom kernel file(s), even without any modification, 
all vtech provided services for InnoTab may not work.



Prerequisitions
---------------
1. A x86 Ubuntu 10.04 Desktop Edition Linux workstation, 
2. Install "Sourcery G++ Lite 2010q1-202 for ARM GNU/Linux", 
	http://www.codesourcery.com/sgpp/lite/arm/portal/release1293
3. A Windows XP (SP3) PC is needed for installing the built kernel to InnoTab 
	hardware.
4. The Windows PC shall be able to access the Linux workstation thru SAMBA in 
	order to run pack tool, or you may copy the built files to your Windows PC.

Kernel build and install
------------------------
1. Obtain this package.
2. Extract this package (*.tar.gz) to a specific folder, in this document, I 
	use "/home/innotab" as an example.
3. Set working directory to "/home/innotab", i.e. cd /home/innotab
4. Run "./mk", it should compiles the kernel and necessary modules.
5. After successfully build, kernel_rel.bin and system_rel.bin should be created
	at /home/innotab.
6. Assume your Windows PC can access /home/innotab as X:, run "AfterBuild.bat" 
	at X:\HackPack, a file inno_kb255_sb255.ugd is generated.
7. Turn on the InnoTab hardware, connect it to the Windows PC.
8. Run "HackInst.exe inno_kb255_sb255.ugd" at X:\HackPack, it installs the built
	kernel to InnoTab hardware.
9. Unplug the USB cable when HackInst.exe finishes, InnoTab hardware shall power
	off itself.
10. Turn on InnoTab hardware again, it is now running the installed kernel.


Busybox build
-------------
1. cd to sdk/external/busybox-1.17.3
2. make -f Makefile.open
3. Follow instructions "Kernel build and install" from step 4.

MTD tools build
---------------
Read the file "how_to_build.txt" in 
	HackPack/mtd-utils-f0cc488.open_source.20120628.tar.gz
